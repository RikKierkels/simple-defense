HTML-5 Canvas Tower Defense Game

- Features a game-loop that takes current fps into account.
- Focus for development is on keeping state immutable and declerative over imperative programming.
- There is little focus on the UI therefore most sprites are placeholders.

TODO:
- Turn towers and projectiles to the direction of their target.
- Change the color of actors on hit.
- Define more waves and balance damage.
